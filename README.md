gl-matrix-core
=========

--- Not Functional Yet! ----

This module wraps up @charlottegore's gl-matrix component in a way that is compatible with node.js. At the time I wrote this, his npm modules couldn't be imported using require() properly due to some name issues.

## Installation

  npm install gl-matrix-core --save

## Usage
	
	This is not functional library yet
